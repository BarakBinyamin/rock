Attempting to solve a mix of technical and social challenges through the lens of computer architecture.

This repo aims to create a simple system for visualizing and solving a network of challenges. If you know of such a tool that already exists, have advice on the existing approaches in this repo, or would like to contribute, please write a comment 

# Run it
coming soon...

## Planning

Ideas: 
1. Define and rank challanges
2. Assign teams

1. Should teams comunicate back to the team makers?
2. Should teams research problems in full or should the research be done in the process of defining challanges. It is likely more chllanges will be found in the proecss of solving another.

### Structure
1. Brainstorm challanges
2. Define the relationship between challenges (For example: Is a challenge a driving factor of a another?)
3. Define the reward of each challenge (Example: Reward = N dollars)
4. Define the cost of each challange (Example Cost = (cost of Salaries)(Predicted time to completion) + (Cost of solution infrastructure)

### Visualizing W/ Graph Notaton (Nodes and Edges)
1. **Node** - A Challange
2. **Directed Edge** - Relationship between challenges 
3. **Size of a Node** - Reward of a challenge
4. **Color of a Node** (green=low cost, red=high cost) - Cost of each challange
5. **Tags** - Skills that would suit each challange


### Asigning teams
1. A team is a group that is assigned to solve a problem
2. A team memeber has a profile with weighted tags that indicate experience, expertise and interests
3. A challange contains wieghts of tags, a team will be constructed in accordance to those weights

# Team Phases
1. Research driving factors of the challange
2. Evaluate the effects of this challenge
3. ????
