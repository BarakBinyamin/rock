Attempting to solve a mix of technical and social challenges through the lens of computer architecture.

This repo aims to create a simple system for visualizing and solving a network of challenges. If you know of such a tool that already exists, have advice on the existing approaches in this repo, or would like to contribute, please write a comment 

# Run it
coming soon...

## Planning

### Structure
1. Brainstorm challanges
2. Define the relationship between challenges (For example: Is a challenge a driving factor of a another?)
3. Define the reward of each challenge (Example: Reward = N dollars)
4. Define the cost of each challange (Example Cost = (cost of Salaries)(Predicted time to completion) + (Cost of solution infrastructure)



### Visualizing W/ Graph Notaton (Nodes and Edges)
1. **Node** - A Challange
2. **Directed Edge** - Relationship between challenges 
3. **Size of a Node** - Reward of a challenge
4. **Color of a Node** (green=low cost, red=high cost) - Cost of each challange
5. Chracteristics
